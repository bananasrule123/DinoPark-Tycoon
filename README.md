# DinoPark Tycoon

This project is an open source implementation of the MS-DOS game released by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC) in 1993. The game is built with the [Unity game engine](https://unity3d.com/) and [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/getting-started/introduction-to-the-csharp-language-and-the-net-framework).

## Overview

Players run a theme park which features dinosaurs as its main attraction. The goal of the game is to care for dinosaurs while keeping the park clean, organized, and well maintained.

## Gameplay

The objective in DinoPark Tycoon is the successful administration of a dinosaur park. Players start off with a $5,000 loan. The money is used to pay for the land, dinosaurs, fencing, food and employees necessary to run the park and pay back the loan; failure to meet loan payments results in the park's foreclosure. Once the loan is paid off, players may expand the park and earn profits. If players are confused, an animated dinosaur appears and guides the players through the game.

Players then visit supply stores to buy the necessary items for park maintenance. The food store provides meat for carnivores, plants for herbivores and seeds for planting. The general store provides fences for the dinosaur pens, with varying degrees of strength and price; concessions such as bathrooms, gift shops and parking lots; and advertising, which is bought per season. The employment office offers the personnel to run the park, and Dino City retails the dinosaurs for the exhibits.

As time passes, players face problems such as escaping dinosaurs, sick employees, and seasonal attendance declines. After paying off the loan, players may choose to sell their park; if it has been successful, the player achieves an onscreen award and an entry on the top scores list.
